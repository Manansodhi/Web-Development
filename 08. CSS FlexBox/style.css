CSS-FLEXBOX
 
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to 
accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. 
Note:- Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
