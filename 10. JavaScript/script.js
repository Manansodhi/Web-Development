console.log("External Script")
alert("External Script hacked")

// will print" then "alert of external script hacked" will appear and  after this body content "Hello" get printed 

// REPL-> read eval print loop(also called shell or console for a language) most programming lanuage those are interpreted in nature can have REPL.
// where we can insert one line each of a lanuage and get evaluated at real time and result is shown to you. and language which needs to be first 
// complied and then run like c++ there is no concept of REPL becoz can't run one line code becoz here we have complete function of main() ..... but
//  javascript is an interpreted language so it reads one line at time and then executes that line  

// Strongly typed language vs Weakly typed language
